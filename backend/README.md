# Backend

Backend setup using Flask

## 1. Create a virtual environment
In this example, we would use python building virtual environment. However, if you are planning to use another software. Please feel free to do so!

we would be using `venv` to run our virtual environment. If you do have venv you could install it with `pip install venv`

After that ae would create a virtual envrionment in your folder backend.

```
python3 -m venv <your virtual environment>
```

Activate your environment
Linux/MacOs
```
source <your virtual environment>/bin./activate
```

Windows
```
<your virtual environment>\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Run the server
```
flask run
```
